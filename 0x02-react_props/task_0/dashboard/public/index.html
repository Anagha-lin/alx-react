      Note the usage of %PUBLIC_URL% in the links above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` directory during the build process.
      Files located inside the `public` directory can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will 
      correctly resolve both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to set up a non-root public URL by executing `npm run build`.
